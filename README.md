# Tutorials, Friendship & Symfony6

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script
for the little project we've done during symfony class.

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Webpack Encore Assets**

This app uses Webpack Encore for the CSS, JS and image files.
Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
or `npm` installed (`npm` comes with Node) and then run:

```
yarn install
yarn encore dev --watch

# or
npm install
npm run watch
```

**Start the Symfony web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
works even better.

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
symfony serve
```

(If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first).

Now check out the site at `https://localhost:8000`

Have fun!
